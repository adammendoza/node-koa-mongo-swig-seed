Node Koa Mongo Swig Seed
=============

> Node-Koa-Mongo-Swig boilerplate app; readily deployable to Heroku for instant lulz.

### Running Locally

Make sure you have `node 0.11.x` installed, as [Koa](http://koajs.com/) requires generators. Also, make sure you have [mongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) installed. Afterwards, run the following commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:lambtron/node-koa-mongo-swig-seed.git
$ cd node-koa-mongo-swig-seed
$ make
```

You should see:

```
listening on port 3000
```

Then, point your browser to `localhost:3000`.

### Deploying to Heroku

Make sure you have a [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) account and you have Heroku's [CLI](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed. Afterwards, run the following commands.

```
$ heroku create
Creating polar-escarpment-5726... done, stack is cedar-14
https://polar-escarpment-5726.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:polar-escarpment-5726.git
Git remote heroku added
$ git push heroku master
```

Then, point your browser to `https://polar-escarpment-5726.herokuapp.com/`.

### App structure

```
.
+-- bin
|   +-- server
+-- lib
|   +-- models.js
|   +-- render.js
|   +-- twitter.js
+-- server
|   +-- routes.js
|   +-- tweet.js

+-- LICENSE
+-- Makefile
+-- package.json
+-- Procfile
+-- README.md
```

This is the basic structure of the Node-Koa app. Logic is separated out between `bin` (configuration of the server), `lib` (setting up libraries for any area of the app to use), `server` (server-side logic), `views` (front-end templating), and the `Makefile`. We will dive deeper into the aforementioend directories, but first a high level overview of the top-level files.

#### .gitignore

This tells git which files to ignore. For node apps, the most common are `node_modules` (the app's dependencies), `.DS_Store` (tells the computer how to format the directory's iconsâ€”completely useless in coding), and `logs` (error or debug logs). Other people working on the repo derive no value in seeing these settings, which is why it is best that git ignores them.

[More about .gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

#### LICENSE

A software license that describes how your code can be used by others.

#### Makefile

Once upon a time, software was tedious to compile and run, especially when you had to include several source files and execute a series of commands each time. The emergence of `Makefile`s simplifies this process dramatically.

The `Makefile` defines a series of instructions that will build and derive the target program, which can be executed within a set of defined commands.

In our `Makefile`, we define `make clean` (remove non-checked-in depedencies), `make debug` (run in debug mode), `make run` (run the server), and `make server` (run the server with nodemon for development purposes). The default setting, which is called when you just call `make`, will call `make run`.

[More about Makefiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)).

#### package.json

This file holds all the metadata related to your app or project. This file is used to give information to [`npm`](http://www.npmjs.org) that allows it to identify the project and its dependencies. This also contains other metadata around the app's description, version, license, and configuration data.

All of the dependencies are located in the `dependencies` property. When you call `npm install`, those are the dependencies and their versions that are installed locally under `node_modules`.

[More information about package.json](https://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/getting-started/npm/what-is-the-file-package-json).

#### Procfile

This is a Heroku specific file that tells Heroku how to run the app. Heroku has various workers, one of them being `web`, which we have to provide the command to initiate the server. In our case, the server can be started with the `make` command, which is why our Procfile is just `web: make`. In other cases, it can be `web: node server.js` or `web: rails s`, etc.

[More information about Procfiles](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile).

#### README.md

This arguably the most important file, as it is the first piece of information a new programmer interacts with to understand your software. For guides to write great readmes, check out the below:

- [How to write a Readme worth reading](https://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/07/16/how-to-write-a-readme-worth-reading/)

#### [bin/server](https://github.com/lambtron/node-koa-mongo-swig-seed/tree/master/bin)

The `make run`, `make server`, and `make debug` commands all call `--harmony bin/server`. The first line of `bin/server` has `#!/usr/bin/env node`, which tells the computer how to execute the rest of the file.

The [`server`](https://github.com/lambtron/node-koa-mongo-swig-seed/blob/master/bin/server) file is for setting up the server. Here you'll see the `PORT` being defined, the various [middleware](https://github.com/lambtron/node-koa-mongo-swig-seed/blob/master/bin/server#L19-L24) that the server will use, [configuring the routes](https://github.com/lambtron/node-koa-mongo-swig-seed/blob/master/bin/server#L26-L32), and finally [initializing the server](https://github.com/lambtron/node-koa-mongo-swig-seed/blob/master/bin/server#L38).
